# Pipes Screensaver, written entirely by Claude
A re-creation of the classic Windows 3D "Pipes" screensaver, written entirely by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, (over many iterations)!

## Start simple and iterate

My main approach when coding with LLMs is to start with as detailed a spec as possible, often created in part with the LLM.

```
I want to re-create the classic Windows screensaver of pipes growing across the screen in javascript. Before restart coding I want to create a clear spec.

- The background is black
- 10 Pipes start in random locations, each with a random matt color. each pipe stays the same color permanently.
- Each pipe quickly grows in one of the cardinal directions, and randomly changes directions every so often.
- There is a minimum distance that pipes must go before changing directions, roughly 5x pipe diameter.
- Pipes cannot turn 180Â° and move back in on themselves
- 75% of the time when a pipe turns there is a smooth elbow connection. 25% of the time a ball joint appears.
- Let's start with a 2-D version and make sure that it looks good!
```

Claude then wrote a detailed spec document that was _mostly_ correct,and I tweaked a few things.

```
Updates to your spec:
* Change minimum straight distance to two times diameter
* No need to do collision detection, it's OK for pipes to cross each other
* If a pipe reaches the edge of the canvas it should turn. If it is a along the edge of the canvas it cannot turn into it
* Elbow radius should be one times the pipe diameter, so the inside of the turn is a hard right angle
```

Just like with humans, it's faster and easier to iterate on the spec than code. I got a pretty good initial 2D version:

I iterated a bit in 2D to get details like balljoints vs elbow joints correct.

Claude will certainly make mistakes, but it's also often quite fast to resolve them:

```
you fixed the bug, but now the joints just look like rectangles
```

I'd say that Claude can fix it's own bugs 2/3 the time. If I try twice and Claude still can't get it, that's when I begrudgingly go look at the code myself.

## Import Magic

```
Looks great! Let's make it 3-D
```

This is the real magic of LLMs for me - in a single command and about 10s Claude completely transformed the code from simply drawing on a canvas to using `Three.js`! This would have taken me a few hours!

Now of course there are some new bugs that I had to debug with claude. In particular, getting the curves and ball joints (especially at the boundary edges) just right took many iterations.

Overall, this felt like the future of what programming will be: 
- Much less writing code
- Much more product managing the LLM to get what you want 
- Still requires understanding and reading code
